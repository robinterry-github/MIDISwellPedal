# MIDISwellPedal

## Introduction

This Arduino program is for a relatively simple MIDI-based controller pedal. It takes
an analogue controller pedal with a 1/4" jack plug, and converts it to a MIDI controller.

I did this project because I couldn't find (at the time) a MIDI-based swell pedal, and
because it seemed an interesting project.

The design uses an Arduino Nano as its main processor. The firmware requires the MIDI
library to be installed.

The firmware and hardware designs are (C) Robin Terry 2023.
